Our project is completely different from the idea described in our
paper prototypes in milestone 2. Per the feedback session we had on 
Friday, we realized that our previous idea was not clearly connected 
to the  theme--"interacting with real-world data." This is why we 
changed our project idea to be a web application that collects data 
from users commuting around UCSD. We plan to collect data such as
users' travel path, time, and distance in order to produce the optimal 
path from one place on campus to another. Our end goal is to help our 
users discover new--and faster--ways to travel around campus. Note that 
our app will include obscure paths, which are ideally more efficient 
than what existing map apps, i.e. Google Maps, offer.
