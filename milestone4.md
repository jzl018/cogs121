IMPROVEMENTS SINCE MILESTONE3:  
We made major UI improvements to our hompeage skeleton. We made the map to be
the main portion of this page by increasing the size of it. Additionally, we
added a task bar at the botton where it will notify users of their next event.
We removed the buttons seen in our previous homepage and added an icon button 
instead that will take users to their agenda. A search bar has also been added
at the top of our homepage. In our agenda page, we cleaned the UI a bit by 
adjusting margins and adding the "add new event" function.

USER PRIVACY:  
We will only be collecting data on the location of our users, granted that we 
have their permission to do so. We will not be gathering any other data beyond
this.
