SCREENSHOTS OF UI SKELETON:

IMPROVEMENTS SINCE MILESTONE3:
We made major UI improvements to our hompeage skeleton. We made the map to be
the main portion of this page by increasing the size of it. Additionally, we
added a task bar at the botton where it will notify users of their next event.
We removed the buttons seen in our previous homepage and added a icon button 
that will take users to their agenda. 

USER PRIVACY:
We will only be collecting data on the location of our users, granted that we 
have their permission to do so. We will not be gathering any other data beyond
this.
