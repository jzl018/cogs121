Proposal(s):

1) When visiting somewhere new it is often difficult finding local sources of
entertainment even with the help of other apps like Yelp, which is mainly used
for discovering places to eat. We hope to alleviate this issue by creating a web
app that will recommend local activities people can enjoy. For example, the
app will have different categories of recommendations such as "free" that will
list local hiking areas or places with nice views that people can explore
without spending a dime. Additionally, this app will have other suggestions such
as bars, arcades, etc that will have a general description and hopefully a sort
of "deals" notification that will inform users with promotions, such as a
Groupon coupon for a particular indoor rock climbing place. The ideal audience
is people who are new to an area and therefore are unaware of what fun things
there are to do, but can also help individuals who live nearby and are looking
for something entertaining to do to satisfy their boredom.

2) Having an efficient workout includes knowing which workouts best fit your
needs (i.e. body type, overall goals, specific muscle group to target, etc.), 
as well as correctly executing the workout (proper form, appropriate amount of
weight, appropriate rest time, etc). In order to maximize efficiency during
exercise, we are proposing a web application that centralizes all of this
information. Upon user input, the app will suggest specific workouts for the 
user, break down exactly how to do each workout with explanatory videos/images, 
and have a timer feature that allows users to track their rest time (typically
1 minute) or the time it takes for them to complete each rep. There will also 
be a feature to log your progress on how much weight you lifted. The progress 
could be presented in a line graph that clearly indicates how users have 
progressed (or regressed) over time.

3) It is common for students to take a class without already having a friend in
that class to rely on for group work or simply for having someone to study with.
For those who learn better when working with someone else, this is an issue. One
solution to this is to create a web application that recommends to the user a
suitable study buddy/friend to work with within a class. Compatibility can be
determined based on user-inputted information. For example, potentially, each
user could put in their times of availability to work, whether they live on- or
off-campus, along with some other useful information. From there, they can
search for a specific class, i.e. "Cogs 121," and be able to look through other
users. and look for a potential partner to work with. The target audience is for
UCSD students, particularly the shy ones. Consider this similar to a dating
app, except there is no romance involved--just wholesome studying.
