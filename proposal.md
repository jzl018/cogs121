Proposal(s):

1) It is common for students to take a class without already having a friend in that class to rely on for groupwork or simply for having someone to study with. For those who learn better when working with someone else, this is an issue. One solution to this is to create a web application that recommends to the user a suitable study buddy/friend to work with within a class. Compatibility can be determined based on user-inputted information. For example, potentially, each user could put in their times of availability to work, whether they live on- or off-campus, along with some other useful information. From there, they can search for a specific class, i.e. "Cogs 121," and be able to look through other users. and look for a potential partner to work with. The target audience is for UCSD students, particularly the shy ones. Consider this similiar to a dating app, except there is no romance involved--just wholesome studying.
