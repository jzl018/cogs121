HOW UI HAS IMPROVED SINCE MILESTONE 5:
On our agenda page, our Event Location text input box now takes in actual
locations found using the Google Maps API. Before, it was just literal
text, i.e. typing in "WLH 2001," where the database stored that exact text.
Now, we can simply type in "War" into the text box, and it will autocomplete 
the event location, where "Warren Lecture Hall" is the first choice. When we
add the event after selecting "Warren Lecture Hall" in the dropdown of
autocompleted names, the event's location is stored as that selected location,
i.e. "Warren Lecture Hall."

Our login page also provides the user more interactive opportunities. Try to 
"Create an Account" and see the nice surprise. Note that there is no true
functionality for this button. It is just a simple homage to our instructors.

A simple addition to our UI is now ours users will have the ability to log out
from the "home" page, using the new button in the upper lefthand corner.
