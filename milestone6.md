HOW UI HAS IMPROVED SINCE MILESTONE 5:
On our agenda page, our Event Location text input box now takes in actual
locations found using the Google Maps API. Before, it was just literal
text, i.e. typing in "WLH 2001," where the database stored that exact text.
Now, we can simply type in "War" into the text box, and it will autocomplete 
the event location, where "Warren Lecture Hall" is the first choice. When we
add the event after selecting "Warren Lecture Hall" in the dropdown of
autocompleted names, the event's location is stored as that selected location,
i.e. "Warren Lecture Hall."
